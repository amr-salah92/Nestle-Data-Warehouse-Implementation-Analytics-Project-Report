## Methodology & Implementation: The Business Case for Our Technical Choices

### 3.1. Technology Stack Selection Rationale

| Technology | Business Rationale & "Why This Tool?" |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Snowflake Database** | Selected for its **scalability and separation of storage/compute**, ensuring our analytics platform can grow with the business while controlling costs. Evidence: Used INFORMATION_SCHEMA, AUTOINCREMENT, and CLONE commands. |
| **SQL for ETL & Modeling** | Chosen as the **industry standard for data transformation** and manipulation, ensuring maintainability and performance for large-scale data processing. |
| **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)** | Implemented for **advanced machine learning capabilities** that go beyond what SQL can deliver, enabling predictive analytics and sentiment classification. |

### 3.2. Data Modeling: Why Star Schema?

**Business Rationale for Star Schema:**
We selected a **Star Schema** design because it is optimized for business intelligence and read-heavy analytical queries. Its simple structure allows business users to easily understand and navigate the data, which was critical for our goal of enabling self-service analytics across the company.

**Dimension Tables** (Business Context):
- `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Customer`, `Dim_Time`, `Dim_Warehouse`, `Dim_Promotion`, `Dim_Order`, `Dim_Location`

**Fact Tables** (Business Measurements):
- `Fact_Sales`: Core transactional data for revenue analysis
- `Fact_Feedback`: Customer reviews and ratings for sentiment tracking
- `Fact_Inventory`: Daily stock levels for supply chain optimization
- `Fact_Promotions`: Promotion duration and discount rates for marketing ROI
- `Fact_Shipments`: Full order fulfillment lifecycle for logistics analysis

### 3.3. ETL & Data Quality: Ensuring Trust in Business Decisions

A meticulous SQL-based ETL process was followed with this business rationale: **"Garbage in, garbage out" is unacceptable for million-dollar business decisions.**

**Process & Business Impact:**
1.  **Extract & Explore:** Profiled all source tables to understand data quality risks before building business-critical reports.
2.  **Transform & Clean:** 
    - Populated dimensions with distinct values to ensure consistent business definitions
    - Joined fact tables to dimension surrogate keys to maintain referential integrity
    - **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates from all dimension tables to prevent double-counting in business metrics
3.  **Load & Validate:** Implemented referential integrity constraints to ensure all business transactions can be properly categorized and analyzed.

## Key Analytical Findings & Business Impact

### 4.1. Inventory Optimization Analysis

**Business Problem:** Inefficient inventory management was simultaneously causing stockouts (lost revenue) and overstock (wasted capital).

#### a) Stockouts and Lost Revenue Analysis

| Product ID | Stockout Duration | Estimated Lost Revenue | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `eb6c8bda-7a5e...` | 41 days | $60,259.61 | **Direct revenue loss from unmet customer demand** |
| `1c4d367d-5bd1...` | 48 days | $26,317.39 | **Longest disruption affecting customer satisfaction** |

**üîç Analytical Approach:** We used **SQL-driven inventory analytics** to join fact and dimension tables, precisely pinpointing stockout duration and correlating it with sales data to model lost revenue.

**üìå Recommendation:** Immediately revise demand forecasting and safety stock levels for high-velocity products to prevent future sales loss.

#### b) Overstock and Carrying Costs Analysis

| Product ID | Excess Inventory Value | Estimated Carrying Cost | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ac5c1864-4ce9...` | $1.53M | $76,734.03 | **Highest capital allocation to non-productive assets** |

**üîç Analytical Approach:** We calculated **carrying cost analytics** by applying a standard annual holding cost rate (5%) to the value of excess, slow-moving inventory identified in the `Fact_Inventory` table.

**üìå Recommendation:** Launch targeted promotions to liquidate slow-moving stock, freeing up $76K+ in working capital.

### 4.2. Logistics & Supply Chain Analysis

**Business Problem:** Delivery delays were risking customer satisfaction, but the root cause was unclear.

| Carrier | On-Time % | Avg. Delay (Days) | Avg. Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UPS | 75.31% | 0.198 | $11.50 |
| Internal Fleet | 74.76% | 0.207 | $11.50 |
| FedEx | 74.58% | 0.205 | $11.56 |

**üîç Analytical Approach:** We performed **carrier performance benchmarking** by analyzing `Fact_Shipments` data to identify patterns in delivery reliability across all logistics partners.

**üìå Business Insight:** Carrier performance is inconsistent with no clear outperformer, suggesting **systemic issues rather than carrier-specific problems**.

**üìå Recommendation:** Engage in collective negotiations with carriers to establish stricter SLAs and investigate root causes of delays (e.g., first-mile vs. last-mile issues).

### 4.3. Customer Sentiment Analysis

**Business Problem:** Manual review of thousands of customer reviews was slow and reactive.

**üîç Analytical Approach:** We implemented a **Naive Bayes classification model** because it's particularly effective for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis and provides fast, scalable processing of large feedback volumes.

**Model Performance:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00      2101
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00     12581
(0 = Negative Sentiment, 1 = Positive Sentiment)
```

**üìå Business Impact:** With 100% accuracy, we can now **automate the triage of 100% of customer feedback**, freeing up analyst time and enabling **real-time brand sentiment monitoring**.

**üìå Recommendation:** Integrate this model into a live dashboard to alert product managers to negative feedback trends as they emerge, enabling proactive customer service.

### 4.4. Sales Forecasting

**Business Problem:** Inventory and workforce planning relied on historical averages rather than predictive insights.

**üîç Analytical Approach:** We deployed an **ARIMA model** because it effectively captures seasonal patterns and trends in time-series data, which is essential for accurate inventory procurement and financial planning.

**Sample Forecast:** 
- Sept 13: $64,993
- Sept 14: $54,628

**üìå Business Impact:** Provides a **data-driven basis for inventory procurement, workforce planning, and financial forecasting**, replacing gut-feel estimates with statistical predictions.

**üìå Recommendation:** Integrate these forecasts into the inventory planning system to dynamically adjust reorder points and safety stock levels.
