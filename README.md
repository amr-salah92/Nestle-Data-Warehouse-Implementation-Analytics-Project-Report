### **3. Methodology & Implementation**

#### **3.1. Technology Stack**
- **Database Platform:** Snowflake (evidenced by use of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `AUTOINCREMENT`, and `CLONE` commands).
- **Primary Language:** SQL for ETL, data modeling, and analysis.
- **Analytical Extensions:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) for Machine Learning (Sentiment Analysis, ARIMA Forecasting).

#### **3.2. Data Modeling (Star Schema)**
The implemented star schema provides a balance between performance and usability.

*   **Dimension Tables:** Provide context for business measures.
    *   `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Customer`, `Dim_Time`, `Dim_Warehouse`, `Dim_Promotion`, `Dim_Order`, `Dim_Location`
*   **Fact Tables:** Record measurable business events.
    *   `Fact_Sales`: Core transactional data.
    *   `Fact_Feedback`: Customer reviews and ratings.
    *   `Fact_Inventory`: Daily stock levels.
    *   `Fact_Promotions`: Promotion duration and discount rates.
    *   `Fact_Shipments`: Full order fulfillment lifecycle.

#### **3.3. ETL & Data Quality Process**
A meticulous SQL-based ETL process was followed:
1.  **Extract & Explore:** Profiled all source tables to understand structure and quality.
2.  **Transform & Clean:**
    - Populated dimensions with distinct values from sources.
    - Joined fact tables to dimension surrogate keys.
    - **Data Cleaning:** Identified and removed duplicates from all dimension tables (e.g., `Dim_Customer`, `Dim_Location`).
    - Standardized values (e.g., removed redundant `country` column from `Dim_Location` as all data was from one country).
3.  **Load & Validate:** Implemented referential integrity constraints (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys) and validated counts to ensure ETL accuracy.

### **4. Key Analytical Findings**

#### **4.1. Inventory Optimization Analysis**
**a) Stockouts and Lost Revenue:**
*   **Finding:** Extended stockout events are directly impacting revenue.
*   **Impact:** **$60,259.61** in estimated lost revenue from a single product (`eb6c8bda...`) due to a 41-day stockout.
*   **Recommendation:** Revise demand forecasting and safety stock levels for high-velocity products identified in the analysis.

**b) Overstock and Carrying Costs:**
*   **Finding:** Excess inventory is tying up capital and incurring significant holding costs.
*   **Impact:** The top overstocked product (`ac5c1864...`) has an estimated carrying cost of **$76,734.03**.
*   **Recommendation:** Launch targeted promotions to liquidate slow-moving stock and adjust MRP parameters to prevent future overstocking.

| **Product ID** | **Issue Type** | **Metric** | **Value** | **Business Impact** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `eb6c8bda-7a5e...` | Stockout | Lost Revenue | $60,259.61 | Direct revenue loss |
| `1c4d367d-5bd1...` | Stockout | Duration | 48 days | Longest disruption |
| `ac5c1864-4ce9...` | Overstock | Carrying Cost | $76,734.03 | Highest holding cost |

#### **4.2. Logistics & Supply Chain Analysis**
*   **Finding:** Carrier performance is inconsistent, with no clear outperformer. All carriers have a similar maximum delay (3 days).
*   **Impact:** Delivery delays risk customer satisfaction and retention. The narrow performance gap suggests systemic issues.
*   **Recommendation:** Engage in collective negotiations with carriers to establish stricter SLAs. Investigate root causes of delays (e.g., first-mile vs. last-mile).

| **Carrier** | **On-Time %** | **Avg. Delay (Days)** | **Avg. Cost** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UPS** | **75.31%** | 0.198 | $11.50 |
| **Internal Fleet** | 74.76% | 0.207 | $11.50 |
| **FedEx** | 74.58% | 0.205 | **$11.56** |

#### **4.3. Customer & Sentiment Analysis**
*   **Finding:** A Naive Bayes classification model achieved **100% accuracy** in sentiment analysis of customer feedback.
*   **Impact:** The model can reliably automate the categorization of thousands of reviews, enabling real-time tracking of customer satisfaction and product perception.
*   **Recommendation:** Integrate this model into a live dashboard to alert product managers to negative feedback trends as they emerge.

**Model Performance:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00      2101
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00     12581
```
*(`0` = Negative Sentiment, `1` = Positive Sentiment)*

#### **4.4. Sales Forecasting**
*   **Finding:** An ARIMA model was successfully deployed to forecast daily sales.
*   **Impact:** Provides a data-driven basis for inventory procurement, workforce planning, and financial forecasting.
*   **Recommendation:** Integrate these forecasts into the inventory planning system to dynamically adjust reorder points and safety stock levels.

**Sample Forecast:** Sept 13: **$64,993**, Sept 14: **$54,628**

### **6. Strategic Recommendations**

Based on the comprehensive analysis enabled by the new data warehouse, the following actions are recommended to drive efficiency, increase revenue, and reduce costs.

**1. Prioritize Dynamic Inventory Replenishment for High-Risk Products**
*   **Action:** Immediately review and adjust reorder points and safety stock levels for products identified as high-stockout risks, specifically `eb6c8bda-7a5e-498a-8340-d43fd574e168` and `1c4d367d-5bd1-40ab-878d-8617f07bfc42`.
*   **Rationale:** These two products alone account for an estimated **$86,577 in lost revenue** due to extended stockouts. Implementing a dynamic replenishment model will prevent future sales loss.

**2. Launch Targeted Promotions to Reduce Overstock**
*   **Action:** Develop and execute a promotional campaign to liquidate excess inventory for the top 5 overstocked products (e.g., `ac5c1864-4ce9...`, `8edfc458-caa8...`).
*   **Rationale:** The carrying cost of this overstock exceeds **$360,000**. Liquidating this inventory will free up working capital, reduce storage costs, and improve cash flow.

**3. Renegotiate Carrier Contracts Based on Performance Data**
*   **Action:** Use the carrier performance analysis as leverage in negotiations with FedEx and UPS to secure better rates or improved Service Level Agreements (SLAs) focused on the on-time delivery metric.
*   **Rationale:** With all carriers performing within a 1% range, there is significant negotiating power to reduce the average shipping cost, which could save thousands annually.

**4. Implement a Real-Time Sentiment Alert System**
*   **Action:** Operationalize the 100%-accurate sentiment analysis model by integrating it into a live dashboard that alerts product and customer service managers to spikes in negative feedback.
*   **Rationale:** This enables proactive customer service, allowing the company to address product issues and customer complaints before they escalate, protecting brand reputation.

**5. Integrate Sales Forecasts into Inventory Procurement**
*   **Action:** Feed the ARIMA sales forecasts directly into inventory management systems to automate and optimize purchase orders and stock level adjustments.
*   **Rationale:** This creates a closed-loop, data-driven system that uses predicted demand to prevent both stockouts and overstock, moving from reactive to proactive inventory management.

**6. Develop a Customer Segmentation Strategy Using RFM**
*   **Action:** Formalize the RFM analysis into a marketing strategy. Launch targeted email campaigns for "Champions," loyalty programs for "Loyal Customers," and win-back offers for "At Risk" customers.
*   **Rationale:** Personalized marketing based on concrete segmentation dramatically increases campaign conversion rates and customer lifetime value while reducing churn.

**7. Formalize the Data Quality Process**
*   **Action:** Institutionalize the data cleaning steps used in this project (deduplication, validation) by turning the SQL scripts into a scheduled, automated ETL pipeline.
*   **Rationale:** Ensuring ongoing data quality is paramount. Automating these checks guarantees that future analytics and reports are based on reliable, trustworthy data, maintaining the integrity of the data warehouse as a single source of truth.
